<title> Email etiquette</title>

<body bgcolor=white>

The following is some advice about the use & misuse of email. Some readers will probably find this page either too obvious or too pedantic and will possibly label the author a "cranky old man". In my defence, I'm not <b>that</b> old. <p>


Why is good style important in email? <p>

There are several reasons. The most obvious is this: being forced to read thr following is depressing:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
want u 2 right me a reference becuz i applying 4 job. the reference must be gud and i need it 2morrow. email me back.
</td>
<tr>
</table>

Like most people, I'm usually very busy. It would be unprofessional for me not to reply urgently to such a request but there is a strong tendency for me to write back after I've done every other job I have to do (and then maybe had a cup of tea, gone home, booked a holiday, packed, gone on holiday, come back with a tan etc.). <p>

A second reason is this: after I've returned from holiday and decided to write a job reference for the above student, what can I say? Well I have evidence that the student is rude, pushy and has a limited grasp of English.
<p>
A third reason is that you are at <b>University</b>. Correct language use should be second nature to you. Moreover, when you apply for a job, if you want to stand any chance of success then you'd better get used to writing plain English now.
<p>
So in summary - developing a good writing style in Email will:
<li>ensure that your email is taken seriously.
<li>avoid giving the impression of being a prat.
